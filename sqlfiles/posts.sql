('Winchester Mystery House', 'There was no plan â€“ no official blueprints were drawn up, no architectural vision was created, and yet a once-unfinished house took shape on a sprawling lot in the heart of San Jose, California. Inside, staircases ascended through several levels before ending abruptly, doorways opened to blank walls, and corners rounded to dead ends.\r\nToday, the house is known as the Winchester Mystery House, but at the time of its construction, it was simply Sarah Winchesterâ€™s House.\r\nSarah Winchester was the widow of William Writ Winchester, heir to the Winchester Repeating Arms Company.\r\nBorn around 1840, Sarah Winchester grew up in a world of privilege. She spoke four languages, attended the best schools around, married well, and eventually gave birth to a daughter, Annie. However, tragedy struck in her late twenties when Annie died, followed by the death of Sarahâ€™s husband William more than a decade later.\r\nAfter Williamâ€™s death in 1881, Sarah inherited roughly $20 million (over $500 million in 2019 dollars) as well as fifty percent of the Winchester Arms company which left her with a continued income equal to $1000 a day (or $26,000 a day in 2019 dollars).\r\nNewly in possession of a massive fortune and struggling with the loss of her husband and daughter, she sought the advice of a medium. She hoped, perhaps, to get advice from the beyond as to how to spend her fortune or what to do with her life.\r\nThough the exact specifics remain between Sarah Winchester and her medium, the story goes that the medium was able to channel dearly departed William, who advised Sarah to leave her home in New Haven, Connecticut, and head west to California. As far as what to do with her money, William answered that too; she was to use the fortune to build a home for the spirits of those who had fallen victim to Winchester rifles, lest she be haunted by them for the rest of her life.\r\nIn 1884, Sarah Winchester purchased what would later become known as the Winchester Mystery House. At the time of the sale, the house was a small unfinished farmhouse, but that quickly changed.\r\nWinchester hired carpenters to work around the clock, expanding the small house into a seven-story mansion. Due to the lack of a plan and the presence of an architect, the house was constructed haphazardly; rooms were added onto exterior walls resulting in windows overlooking other rooms. Multiple staircases would be added, all with different sized risers, giving each staircase a distorted look.\r\nStranger so was the fact that many of the alterations seemed pointless. Staircases would ascend several levels then end abruptly, doors would open to solid walls, and hallways would turn a corner and end in a dead-end.\r\nAdditionally, Winchester insisted that the home be built exclusively out of redwood â€“ however, she didnâ€™t like the look of the wood, so she insisted it be covered with a stain and a faux grain. By the time the house was completed, over 20,000 gallons of paint had been used to cover the wood.\r\nBy the turn of the century, Sarah Winchester had her ghost house: an oddly laid out mansion, with seven stories, 161 rooms, 47 fireplaces, 10,000 panes of glass, two basements, three elevators, and a mysterious fun-house-like interior.\r\nAnyone who set foot in the home could tell that no expense had been spared.\r\nGold and silver chandeliers hung from the ceilings above hand-inlaid parquet flooring. Dozens of artful stained-glass windows created by Tiffany & Co. dotted the walls, including some designed by Louis Comfort Tiffany himself. One window, in particular, was intended to create a prismatic rainbow effect on the floor when light flowed through it â€“ of course, the window ended up on an interior wall, and thus the effect was never achieved.\r\nEven more luxurious than the fixtures was the plumbing an electrical work. Rare for the time, the Winchester Mystery House boasted indoor plumbing, including coveted hot running water, and push-button gas lighting available throughout the home. Additionally, forced-air heating flowed throughout the house.\r\nUnfortunately, in 1904, an earthquake struck San Jose, and the Winchester Mystery House sustained a hefty amount of damage. Thanks to the floating foundation (a foundation that equals the weight of the surrounding soil) the entire house was saved from collapse. The top three floors were ultimately removed, leaving the house with only four stories, as seen today.\r\nThroughout the years-long construction of the Winchester Mystery House, Sarah Winchester would never confirm that she was building a haunted house. However, stories and rumors swirled throughout San Jose.\r\nThe contractors who worked on the house reported Winchester having daily seances with local mediums, in an effort to reach â€œgood spirits.â€ These â€œgood spiritsâ€ were reportedly consulted to find out how to best appease the spirits whom she was allegedly building the house for. These spirits are reportedly what called Winchester to make so many illogical additions to the home.\r\nThe Winchester Mystery House at the time Sarah Winchester resided there. Its seven stories are visible here.\r\nFar after the construction was completed, Winchester continued to make efforts to appease the victims of the Winchester rifles.\r\nOut of the 13 bathrooms in the home, only one was functional, in an effort to confuse any ghosts wishing to haunt a spigot. Furthermore, she would sleep in a different room every night in the Winchester house, and use secret passageways to get from room to room so that no spirits could follow her.\r\nIn the years Sarah Winchester lived in the house, the residents of San Jose whispered about its strange construction and even stranger inhabitant, but it was in the years after her death that the wild stories became even wilder.\r\nAfter her death in September of 1922, Sarah Winchester left all of her belongings to her niece, Marion, who had served as her personal secretary later in life. However, the Winchester Mystery House was never mentioned in her will, adding to the mystery of the home.\r\nAfter appraisers deemed the house worthless due to its strange design, damage from the earthquakes and long-winded construction, Marion took everything in it and auctioned it off. The current owners of the house claim it took six weeks to empty the house of all furniture, though the report is uncorroborated.\r\nAfter the house was emptied, a local investor purchased the home for a cool $135,000. Just five months after Sarah Winchester died, the Winchester Mystery House was opened to the public for tours.\r\n', 'Amar Jain', 'img3.jpg', 'amar123@gmail.com'),
('Planchettes- Are they real?', 'This is probably a dying trend but Bengalis grow up with Rabindranath Tagore hanging over their shoulders in almost every aspect of their life. It wasnâ€™t any different, when three friends and me decided to do a planchette, because oh well, Tagore has done it too! If a Nobel Laureate endorses such an idea, that idea must be real, no?\r\nThe idea of planchette was more attractive to our 11 year old minds than chocolate or discussing â€”cough coughâ€”adult topics. It was akin to entering forbidden territories, and finally finding answers to oxymoronic questions as to how does it feel to be dead, and then compare notes as laid out by various texts around us, as to the afterlife.\r\nAll through my child to adult life, I heard so many stories of planchettesâ€”as to:\r\n1. How someoneâ€™s side of face had changed after doing a planchette, with skin and blood vessels all maimed,\r\n2. How someone had turned lunatic (or possessed) and could never come back to being their normal self after doing it,\r\n3. How Gandhi actually came in someoneâ€™s planchette and answered some history questions with information not to be found in textbooks, as well as,\r\n4. How the spirit of Rohit Khosla, an Indian designer who died in 1994 at the age of 36 years and was known to be gay, had sex with a female friend of mine, and she couldnâ€™t control the entity (this person hadnâ€™t seen Hawa or The Entity, and was dead serious).\r\nIâ€™d wonder about the goats killed (sacrificed) during Kali Puja â€”if one of them comes back, and since I wouldnâ€™t know due to lack of mechanism in recognizing as to which one came back, how do I know to ask the right questions and whether they are giving out the right answer? Iâ€™d also struggle with the dilemma of whether goats get supernaturally-abled to speak human language once they receive the ghost goat status.\r\nGoing by the theory of reincarnation and karma, our souls/spirits are roaming around the face of earth in various forms of life. Based on that logic, goats and mosquitoes should have a spirit too. And based on the billions of mosquitoes Iâ€™ve killed in my life, Iâ€™d also wonder about whether they vindicate their death through their ghost avatars and come bite me again, invisibly.\r\nPlanchette was my only way to get some kind of answers to these questionsâ€”because it was a window to afterlife and settle my innumerable questions regarding the Malthusian struggle that must be going on among spirits/souls to get back into the forms of life cycle. It was meant to be an emotional catharsis.\r\nThe first planchette I did with my friends was done with a ritualistic rigour that would please your mother-in-law. However, 10 minutes after it had started, someone started chuckling, with all that silence in darkness between us, and that created the unholy wave of infectious laughter that cuts the connection to afterlife.\r\nThereafter, we chucked out those whoâ€™d chuckle and continue doing our sessions.\r\nPlanchettes worked, in making us focus on a single thing.\r\nInitially, to think about the dead person continuously was bit of a hassle, because all kinds of thoughts, such as how to give it back to the class bully, and how to see our crush again, would be crouching onto our minds. But we were all determined to make it work, having been inspired by numerous â€œrealâ€ personal accounts, and evidences as theyâ€™ve happened in stories and movies. We believed that if planchettes didnâ€™t work, that could only mean we are not doing the job right.\r\nThe only snag herein is, planchettes have worked for a whole lot of things, other than getting the spirit we wanted to bring.\r\nYou canâ€™t bring what doesnâ€™t exist.\r\nBut planchettes work if youâ€™d like to get a power nap, or think deeply about something, or want to hold the hand of your special person in the dark room when your friends canâ€™t catch you, or pass on a stinky fart by taking advantage of the situation of forced silence, or something to build upon as you tell others how it worked while they munch on your story and chips.\r\nWhen you meet those who tell you that it works, ask these successful planchetters to call forth Anna Nicole Smith or Sunanda Pushkar or Osama bin Laden or Marilyn Monroe and ask them exactly how did they die, what it felt like then, as well as other assorted question as to whether Osama really watched the porn stash that was found from that den.\r\n', 'Satakshi De', 'img7.jpg', 'satakshi@gmail.com');
